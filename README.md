# Decoding-lodash

Greetings to **Decoding-lodash**! This project serves as a playground where we decode some of the famous lodash methods by, constructing their **basic versions** using plain JavaScript.

## About

Lodash is a widely used utility library for JavaScript that provides a plethora of helpful functions for tasks like array manipulation, object handling, and more. In this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of these methods by re-implementing them ourselves. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn and practice while exploring the inner workings of these utility functions.

## How It Works

Each method we choose to decode will have its own JS file.

We'll break down the logic, step by step, and create our basic JavaScript implementation of the method. By doing this, we'll gain insights into the underlying concepts and algorithms behind these functions.


## Getting Started

To get started with decoding-lodash, simply clone the repository and explore the method files. You can run them and test them in your preferred JavaScript environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decoding-lodash.git

cd decoding-lodash
```
